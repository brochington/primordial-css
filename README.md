# Primordial CSS

Primordial CSS is a styling system using only HTML/CSS. Most targeting of elements is done via custom HTML attributes, which in many ways resembles the use of "props" in libraries such as React. CSS Custom Properties (css variables) are used almost everywhere, allowing for easy configuration and theming.

Primordial is not trying to replace something like Tailwind.
